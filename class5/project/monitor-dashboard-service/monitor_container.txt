This is a comprehensive Docker Container Monitoring Script that provides real-time monitoring, 
alerting, and visualization for Docker containers. Let me break down its key components and functionality:
Primary Purpose
The script monitors Docker container health, resource usage, and application performance with multiple 
monitoring modes and alerting capabilities.
Core Features
1. Resource Monitoring

CPU Usage: Tracks container CPU consumption as a percentage
Memory Usage: Monitors both absolute (MB) and percentage memory usage
Response Time: Measures application response time via HTTP health checks
Container Status: Checks if container is running or stopped

2. Health Checking

Makes HTTP requests to a /health endpoint on port 80
Measures response times and validates HTTP status codes
Determines application health based on response codes (200 = healthy)

3. Alert System

Threshold-based alerts for CPU, memory, and response time
Alert logging to dedicated log files
Extensible alert mechanisms (commented code shows email/Slack integration options)
Real-time notifications when thresholds are exceeded

4. Data Logging & Reporting

CSV metrics file for historical data tracking
General activity logs for monitoring events
Alert-specific logs for threshold violations
Comprehensive reports with statistical summaries

5. Multiple Operating Modes
Single Check Mode (monitor):
bash./script.sh monitor
# Performs one-time health and resource check
Continuous Mode (continuous):
bash./script.sh continuous
# Runs monitoring every 60 seconds in background
Live Interactive Mode (live):
bash./script.sh live
# Real-time dashboard with visual progress bars and live updates
Report Generation (report):
bash./script.sh report
# Generates comprehensive monitoring report with statistics
Configuration
The script uses environment variables for flexible configuration:
bash# Example usage with custom settings
CONTAINER_NAME="my-app" \
CPU_THRESHOLD="75" \
MEMORY_THRESHOLD="85" \
RESPONSE_TIME_THRESHOLD="2000" \
./script.sh live
Visual Features
The live mode includes:

Color-coded progress bars (green/yellow/red based on usage levels)
Real-time dashboard with Unicode box drawing characters
Status indicators using emojis
Live metric updates every 2 seconds

Data Output

Metrics CSV: timestamp,cpu_percent,memory_usage_mb,memory_percent,response_time_ms,status
Alert logs: Timestamped alert entries
Reports: Statistical summaries with averages and recent alerts

Key Technical Details
Resource Collection
Uses docker stats JSON output to extract CPU and memory metrics, with careful parsing to handle different 
memory units (MiB/GiB).
Health Checking
Assumes containerized applications expose a health endpoint and measures both availability and response time.
Error Handling
Includes comprehensive error handling for missing containers, network issues, and malformed data.
Typical Use Cases

DevOps monitoring of production containers
Performance testing and resource optimization
Automated alerting for container issues
Historical analysis of container performance
Real-time troubleshooting with the live dashboard

This script essentially transforms basic Docker monitoring into a comprehensive observability solution 
with logging, alerting, and visualization capabilities.
