Remove everything in the code related to AWS_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_SECRET_KEY. 

Remove in docker-compose.yml and alert_service.py

Create an IAM role ec2_ses and attach AWS_SES_Fullaccess IAM Policy to it.

Then select the instance Actions -> Security -> Modify IAM Role and select the role ec2_ses

Finally i have deployed the container monitoring app in EC2. After changing the instance type to t3.medium i had to edit the SG inbound rules. Then only i can access the app using public ip. 

publicip:8001 for monitoring dashboard
publicip:8080 for app

Allow TCP port 8001 from 0.0.0.0/0
Allow TCP port 8080 from 0.0.0.0/0
Allow TCP port 443 from 0.0.0.0/0 (if using HTTPS)

I had to add sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER 
after installing docker
